# Modern Angular With Signals – Practice Projects

This is my fork of the **Modern Angular With Signals Course** repository from Angular University 🧑‍💻.  
The purpose of this fork is to complete, experiment with, and improve the exercises as part of my learning journey.

Original course: https://angular-university.io/course/angular-signals-course :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}


## About the Course

This course teaches how to use the **Angular Signals API** — a modern reactive primitive in Angular — to build reactive and efficient Angular applications.  
It covers the core concepts of signals such as:

- Creating and updating **signals**
- Derived values with **computed**
- Reacting with **effects**
- Interoperability with RxJS
- Practical signal-based UI patterns

Throughout the course you’ll build real Angular examples using the Signals API to replace or complement traditional reactive patterns. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## Technologies

- Angular (latest version used in the course)
- TypeScript
- Angular Signals: `signal()`, `computed()`, `effect()`
- Git & GitHub
- RxJS


## What I Practiced

In this fork I completed the exercises and added my own improvements:

✔️ Core Angular Signals usage  
✔️ Signal-based components  
✔️ Computed and derived values  
✔️ Reactive patterns with minimal RxJS  
✔️ Effects and side-effect handling  
✔️ Code improvements and refactors  
✔️ Additional comments and explanations

# Installation pre-requisites

IMPORTANT: Please use Node 22 (Long Term Support version).

# Installing the Angular CLI

Start by doing a global installation of the Angular CLI:

    npm install -g @angular/cli

# How To install this repository

you can install the main branch using the following commands:

    git clone https://github.com/angular-university/angular-signals-course.git

    cd angular-signals-course

    npm install

# What branches does this repository have?

This repository has 2 branches:

- the main branch contains the final code that you will have created at the end of the course
- the 1-start branch contains the starting point for the course

If you don't use Git, it's also possible to download each branch as a ZIP file.

To do so, you must first select the correct branch from the branch dropdown here on top of this screen on Github. 

Once inside the right branch, click the green "Code" button and select "Download ZIP".

# Running the local backend server

In order to be able to provide more realistic examples, we will need in our playground a small REST API backend server. 

We can start the sample application backend with the following command:

    npm run server

# To run the Frontend Server

To run the frontend part of our code, we will use the Angular CLI:

    npm start

You can also start the frontend application using the following command:

    ng serve

The application is visible in port 4200: [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)
